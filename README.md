### "its the quaffiest!"

rust cli that is for playing around with point cloud data and geoarrow/geoparquet

## setup
we trying out devenv, so get that going and then do a `devenv shell` to enter the matrix

## usage
### not yet updated for actual non local dev use pray for me

locally, do a good ol `cargo run -- <your args>`

don't know what you're doing? just do `cargo run` and you'll see the CLI help
