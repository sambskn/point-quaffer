# point-quaffer
### "its the quaffiest!"

rust cli that is for playing around with point cloud data and geoarrow/geoparquet

## setup
so actually it's kinda annoying to use the gdal rust crate, so we're trying to use `devenv` and `nix` to pin some stuff downt o have a reproducible dev environment

start up the shell with `devenv shell` and you'll pretty much be ready to roll, no more docs, just read the conifg sorry not sorry

## usage
### not yet updated for actual non local dev use pray for me

locally, do a good ol `cargo run -- <your args>`

don't know what you're doing? just do `cargo run` and you'll see the CLI help
